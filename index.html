            #Yoga is a form of mind-body fitness that involves a combination of muscular activity and an internally directed mindful focus on awareness of the self, the breath, and energy.
            <br>#The word "yoga" comes from a Sanskrit root "yuj" which means union, or yoke, to join, and to direct and concentrate one's attention.
            <br>#Yoga is recognized as a form of mind-body medicine that integrates an individual's physical, mental and spiritual components to improve aspects of health, particularly stress related illness.

    <u>Ashtanga</u>, with it's emphasis on daily practice, many vinyasas, and mastery of postures in sequence is one of the most effective. many types of power yoga, which are based on Ashtanga principles, also live up to their name. Rocket yoga is another particularly strong style of practice, as is jivamukti.

<h5 class="project-heading4"><u>2. It Promotes Healthy Eating Habits.</u></h5>
<p class="project-text2">
    Yoga encourages mindfulness, which may be used to help promote mindful eating and healthy eating habits.
<br> current research suggests that yoga practitioners are more mindful eaters, consume more fruits and vegetables and gain less weight over time when compared to individuals who do not practice yoga.
<br> individuals who practice mindful eating are also able to monitor their food intake based on their hunger-level and have the ability to end a meal or snack based on their bodies' internal cues or satisfaction level, rather than letting external cues or emotions determine intakes.
